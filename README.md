# pachde-One

This is a work in progress -- the first VCV Rack plugin for pachde (#d).

All pachde-One modules have light, dark, and high contrast themes. Right click to choose a theme.
They also come with caps on the screws for an elegant look.
All screws are removable if you're more relaxed about your Rack.
