# pachde-One

The first VCV Rack plugin for pachde (#d).

All pachde-One modules have Light, Dark, and High Contrast themes. Right click to choose a theme.
They also come with caps on the screws for an elegant look.
All screws are removable if you're more relaxed about your Rack and not worried about the panels falling out.
