# pachde1 TODO

## Null

- Selection of looks at edges: rivets, welds, wear and tear.

## Skiff

- Image rail overlay (image formats)
- Undo for PackModules?

## Guide: Panel Design Guides

- Widget mover: move widget
  - Record position data as text that can be copied
  - Position data in format that can be used at runtime (provide library for runtime positioning)

- Panel blank module to use with designer.
  - Basic panel templates
  - User SVG
  - Widget library
  - Save to working folder
  - Generate ModuleWidget code

## FancyBox

- Skiff: it would be cool to be able to support dragging a skiff box by bezel/bg
- Skiff: background rails? (honoring Skiff:Alt rails!)
- Skiff: ears? (Purfenator parity)
- randomize?
- randomize trigger?

## Copper

Idea: "Remote extender"/"Sticky extender"/"Linked extender" - once extended, allowing moving the extender elsewhere in the patch, retaining the connection.
Message passing doesn't work in this scenario.

## Alternate module browser

- ala CHEM: Preset, with selectable width.
- Search/filter defined fields.
- Select columns.
- Custom tags (with export/import for community sharing).
- Pop out to full screen.
- Multi-select for adding.
- Companion detail extender to show full details of selected module.
