1. **Change rail** hamburger menu contains a selection of alternate rails for your rack, or choose a custom rail SVG of your own.
  Some SVGs don't work, but most will display fine.
  The provided alternate rail SVGs have the identical size of Rack's rail SVGs, but that isn't required.

1. **Derail** Toggles between Rack's rails visible and invisible (black).

1. **Calm knobs and ports** Toggle between standard Rack black knobs and i/o ports and calm ones that are less glossy and ornate.
  The effect is a bit subtle.

1. **Unscrew** Unscrew all modules in the Rack.
  If modules start falling out, you can click it again to restore the screws.
  Only standard Rack screws are affected.
  I don't have the right screwdriver for the custom screws that some modules use. #d One comes with its own screwdriver in the module menu.

1. **Pack modules** Pack your modules together in neat, left-aligned rows. Any vacant rows are filled. Modules in a given row are kept together in the same row to avoid breaking extenders.

1. **Zoom to selection** (no button). Press F6 with the mouse over **Skiff** to Zoom just the selected modules.
