## Extender

[Copper](Copper.md) extends Info to set it's panel, background, and text colors.
By default Copper sets the panel color.
In the menu, choose **Interior** for Copper, and now Copper changes the text background when it's on the left, and the text color when it's on the right.
Two Coppers can work simultaneously in this configuration.

You can have some fun turning on **Bright text in a dark room**, setting **Copper** to **Interior**, and putting a modulated Copper on either side.
