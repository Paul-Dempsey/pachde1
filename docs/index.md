# pachde-One Modules for VCV Rack

All pachde-One modules have Light, Dark, and High Contrast themes.
You can choose independent themes, or set the theme for all pachde-One modules currently in the patch.
Youc an also follow the Rack UI theme, or the "prefer dark panels" setting.
They also come with caps on the screws for an elegant look.
All pachde One screws are removable if you're more relaxed about your Rack and don't worry about the modules falling out.
For your other modules, try the _unScrew_ button in the new **Skiff** module.

Right click to choose a theme, add/remove screws, and choose additional options for the module.
