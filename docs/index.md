# pachde-One Modules for VCV Rack

All pachde-One modules have Light, Dark, and High Contrast themes.
They also come with caps on the screws for an elegant look.
All screws are removable if you're more relaxed about your Rack and don't worry about the modules falling out.

Right click to choose a theme, add/remove screws, set a custom panel color, or choose additional options for the module.
